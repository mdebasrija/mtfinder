This is a simple tool to find the gene and the base at a specific position in the human mitochondrial genome. For now, it is really bare-bones, just accepting the position and returning the gene and the base at that position according to the reference sequence of human mitochondrial genome. (GenBank Accession Number : NC_012920.1)

You can download the code and the files required as a zip file. THe Mito_genes file contains the coordinates for each gene and the control gene. The app.R file is the file that contains the code. Remember to change the path to the files before running them!

Hope this helps.
